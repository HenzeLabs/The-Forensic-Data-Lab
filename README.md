# The Forensic Data Lab: Signal Restoration as a Service

This project provides the infrastructure for a forensic-grade revenue signal recovery service specializing in Shopify e-commerce brands generating $5M-$20M annually.

## Service Overview

The Forensic Data Lab addresses the critical 90% failure rate in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) implementations. By utilizing automated browser emulation and diagnostic scripts, we restore the data signals required for algorithmic advertising optimization.

## Problem Statement

- 90% of GA4 implementations contain structural flaws
- Improper setups cause 11% to 20% traffic underreporting
- Signal loss leads to 20% to 30% discrepancies between Shopify and Ad platforms

**Tagline:** Recover the 20% of revenue your ad algorithms are currently blind to.

## The Solution: The Automated Verification Loop

1. **SCAN** - Automated browser emulation to detect tag firing failures and script loading errors
2. **AUDIT** - Deep-dive identification of structural flaws like double-counting or missing lower-funnel data
3. **RESTORE** - Deployment of optimized configurations to recover revenue signals
4. **VERIFY** - Data reconciliation across Shopify, GA4, and third-party attribution platforms
