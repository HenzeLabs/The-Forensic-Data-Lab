# The Forensic Data Lab - Sales Materials & Call Scripts

## 📞 Discovery Call Script

### Opening (2 minutes)
**"Hi [Name], thanks for booking this call. I'm [Your Name] from The Forensic Data Lab. I saw that you requested a tracking audit for [website] - what made you reach out to us?"**

*Listen actively. Common responses:*
- "Our Facebook ads aren't showing conversions"
- "Numbers don't match between GA4 and Shopify"
- "Not sure if our tracking is set up correctly"
- "Heard GA4 tracking is complicated"

**Follow-up:** "That's exactly what we specialize in fixing. Before we dive into your specific situation, can you tell me a bit about your business?"

### Discovery Questions (10 minutes)

#### Business Context
1. **"What's your monthly revenue?"** *(Critical for positioning)*
2. **"How much are you spending on advertising per month?"**
3. **"What's your main traffic source - Facebook, Google, email?"**
4. **"Who's currently managing your analytics and tracking?"** *(In-house vs agency)*

#### Problem Identification
5. **"When you look at your GA4, what specific issues are you seeing?"**
6. **"How confident are you in your tracking data right now, 1-10?"** *(If 8+, ask why they called)*
7. **"What decisions have you made recently based on your analytics data?"**
8. **"Have you ever had to pause a profitable campaign because the tracking looked bad?"**

#### Pain Points & Urgency
9. **"What happens if this tracking situation doesn't get fixed?"**
10. **"How long has this been a concern for you?"**
11. **"What's prevented you from fixing this before?"**

### Problem Agitation (5 minutes)

**"Based on what you're telling me, here's what's likely happening..."**

**For E-commerce:**
"Your Facebook ads are probably working better than the data shows. When tracking is broken - and we see this with 80% of businesses - you're essentially flying blind. You might be cutting profitable campaigns or doubling down on ones that aren't actually working. For a business doing [revenue] per month, broken tracking typically costs about [calculate 30% of ad spend] in wasted budget monthly."

**For Lead Gen:**
"Without proper tracking, you have no idea which campaigns are bringing in your best customers. You might be optimizing for cheap leads that don't convert, while the channels bringing quality leads look 'expensive' in your reports. This is probably costing you [calculate impact] in lost opportunities each month."

### Solution Presentation (8 minutes)

**"Here's exactly how we fix this..."**

#### The Ralph Wiggum Loop Process
**"We use what we call the 'Ralph Wiggum Loop' - named after the Simpsons character who never gives up. Here's how it works:"**

1. **AUDIT**: "We scan every single tracking event on your site automatically"
2. **DIAGNOSE**: "We identify root causes, not just symptoms"  
3. **REPAIR**: "We implement enterprise-grade fixes"
4. **VERIFY**: "We test every event until it's perfect"
5. **REPEAT**: "We keep looping until we hit 100% accuracy"

#### Service Tiers Positioning

**For Smaller Businesses ($50K-$200K/month):**
"Based on your size, I'd recommend our **Tracking Detective** package. You get the complete audit and step-by-step fix guide for $497. Perfect if you have someone technical who can implement."

**For Medium Businesses ($200K-$1M/month):**  
"For a business your size, our **Tracking Surgeon** service makes the most sense. We handle everything for you - $1,497 and you don't touch a thing. Most clients see ROI within the first week from better attribution."

**For Larger Businesses ($1M+/month):**
"You'd benefit from our **Tracking Architect** solution. We design a custom tracking architecture that scales with your business - $2,997 but includes quarterly audits for a full year."

### Objection Handling (5 minutes)

#### "It's too expensive"
**"I understand cost is a concern. Let me ask - how much are you spending on ads monthly? [Listen] Okay, so if broken tracking is causing you to waste just 20% of that budget, that's [calculate] per month. Our service pays for itself in the first month, and the improved attribution lasts forever."**

#### "We'll think about it"
**"Of course, this is an important decision. Can I ask - what specifically would you need to think about? [Listen] I ask because in my experience, when tracking is broken, every day you wait costs money. What would need to happen for you to feel confident moving forward today?"**

#### "Our agency said they'd fix it"
**"That's great that they're willing to help. Quick question - how long have they been saying they'll fix it? [Listen] Here's what I've learned: most agencies are great at running ads, but tracking is a specialized skill. We do nothing but fix tracking. Would you rather have them focus on what they do best - optimizing campaigns - while we handle the tracking foundation?"**

#### "We're not sure it's actually broken"
**"That's fair - and honestly, that uncertainty is exactly why you should get clarity. Would you rather know for sure your tracking is perfect, or continue making decisions based on potentially incomplete data? Our audit will either confirm everything's working great, or show you exactly what needs fixing. Either way, you'll have confidence in your data."**

#### "Can you guarantee results?"
**"Absolutely. We offer a 100% money-back guarantee. If we can't fix your tracking to 100% accuracy, you don't pay. In three years of doing this, we've never had to refund a client because we couldn't deliver results. The 'Ralph Wiggum Loop' doesn't stop until it's perfect."**

#### "We need to check with our team"
**"That makes total sense. Who else would be involved in this decision? [Listen] Would it be helpful if I sent you some information to share with them? What questions do you think they'll have?"**

### Closing (5 minutes)

#### The Assumptive Close
**"Based on everything we've discussed, it sounds like the [service tier] is the right fit. The next step is getting you scheduled. We have availability this week or next - what works better for your timeline?"**

#### The Alternative Close
**"Would you prefer to start with the Detective package and get the audit first, or jump straight into having us fix everything with the Surgeon service?"**

#### The Urgency Close
**"I want to be transparent - we only take on a limited number of clients each month to ensure quality. This week I have [number] spots remaining. Would you like to secure one of those?"**

## 🔥 Email Outreach Templates

```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s GA4 setup

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're the [Title] at [Company] - impressive growth you've been having!

Quick question: How confident are you in your GA4 tracking accuracy?

I ask because I just audited a similar company in [industry] and found their tracking was only 34% accurate. They were about to cut their Facebook ad budget because it "wasn't working" - turns out the tracking was broken, not the ads.

If you're interested, I can run a quick audit on [website] and show you exactly what's working vs. what's broken. Takes 5 minutes to set up, 48 hours to complete.

Worth checking?

Best,
[Name]
P.S. The audit is free - I just like helping businesses avoid expensive tracking mistakes.

Hi [Name],

Did my last email get buried? I know the feeling.

Quick reminder: I offered to audit [Company]'s tracking setup. Based on your website, I suspect there might be some attribution issues (most businesses have them post-GA4 migration).

If you'd rather not know about potential tracking problems, totally understand.

But if you're curious what issues might be lurking, takes 30 seconds to request: [link]

Either way, hope [Company] keeps crushing it.

That's it.
