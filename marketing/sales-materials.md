# The Forensic Data Lab - Sales Materials & Call Scripts

## Discovery Call Script

### Opening (2 minutes)

\*\*"Hi [Name], thanks for booking this call. I'm [Your Name] from The Forensic Data Lab. I saw that you requested a revenue signal analysis for [website] - what made you reach out to us?"

_Listen actively. Common responses:_

- "Our Meta Ads can't see our purchases"
- "Revenue numbers don't match between GA4 and Shopify"
- "Not sure if our revenue signals are accurate"
- "Concerned about signal loss from iOS changes"

**Follow-up:** "That's exactly what we specialize in recovering. Before we dive into your revenue signal analysis, can you tell me a bit about your business?"

### Discovery Questions (10 minutes)

#### Business Context

1. **"What's your monthly revenue?"** _(Critical for positioning)_
2. **"How much are you spending on advertising per month?"**
3. **"What's your main traffic source - Facebook, Google, email?"**
4. **"Who's currently managing your analytics and tracking?"** _(In-house vs agency)_

#### Problem Identification

5. **"When you look at your GA4, what specific issues are you seeing?"**
6. **"How confident are you in your tracking data right now, 1-10?"** _(If 8+, ask why they called)_
7. **"What decisions have you made recently based on your analytics data?"**
8. **"Have you ever had to pause a profitable campaign because the tracking looked bad?"**

#### Pain Points & Urgency

9. **"What happens if this tracking situation doesn't get fixed?"**
10. **"How long has this been a concern for you?"**
11. **"What's prevented you from fixing this before?"**

### Problem Agitation (5 minutes)

**"Based on what you're telling me, here's what's likely happening..."**

**For E-commerce:**
"Your Facebook ads are probably working better than the data shows. When signals are degraded - which is common post-iOS 14 - you're essentially flying blind. You might be cutting profitable campaigns or doubling down on ones that aren't actually working. For a business doing [revenue] per month, signal loss can represent a significant portion of your ad spend in wasted budget monthly."

**For Lead Gen:**
"Without proper tracking, you have no idea which campaigns are bringing in your best customers. You might be optimizing for cheap leads that don't convert, while the channels bringing quality leads look 'expensive' in your reports. This is probably costing you [calculate impact] in lost opportunities each month."

### Solution Presentation (8 minutes)

**"Here's exactly how we restore this..."**

#### The Automated Verification Loop Process

**"We use what we call the 'Automated Verification Loop'. Here's how it works:"**

1. **AUDIT**: "We scan every single tracking event on your site automatically"
2. **DIAGNOSE**: "We identify root causes, not just symptoms"
3. **REPAIR**: "We implement enterprise-grade fixes"
4. **VERIFY**: "We test every event until it's perfect"
5. **REPEAT**: "We keep looping until your tracking meets our quality standards"

#### Service Tiers Positioning

**For brands wanting clarity first ($5M-$10M/year):**
"Based on your size, I'd recommend starting with our **Forensic Diagnostic** at $1,450. You get a complete revenue leakage analysis showing exactly where your signals are breaking and how much revenue you're missing. Perfect for understanding the full picture before committing to implementation."

**For brands ready to fix everything ($10M-$20M/year):**
"For a business your size, our **Signal Restoration** service makes the most sense at $2,950. We handle everything for you - the diagnostic plus full implementation. Most clients recover their investment within the first month from improved attribution alone."

**For ongoing protection (any size):**
"After restoration, many clients add our **Shadow Monitoring** at $350/month. We continuously monitor your signal integrity and catch issues before they impact your data. Think of it as insurance for your analytics investment."

### Objection Handling (5 minutes)

#### "It's too expensive"

**"I understand cost is a concern. Let me ask - how much are you spending on ads monthly? [Listen] Okay, so if signal loss is causing you to waste just 20% of that budget, that's [calculate] per month. Our service pays for itself in the first month, and the improved attribution lasts forever."**

#### "We'll think about it"

**"Of course, this is an important decision. Can I ask - what specifically would you need to think about? [Listen] I ask because in my experience, when signals are degraded, every day you wait costs money. What would need to happen for you to feel confident moving forward today?"**

#### "Our agency said they'd fix it"

**"That's great that they're willing to help. Quick question - how long have they been saying they'll fix it? [Listen] Here's what I've learned: most agencies are great at running ads, but tracking is a specialized skill. We do nothing but restore signals. Would you rather have them focus on what they do best - optimizing campaigns - while we handle the tracking foundation?"**

#### "We're not sure it's actually broken"

**"That's fair - and honestly, that uncertainty is exactly why you should get clarity. Would you rather know for sure your tracking is perfect, or continue making decisions based on potentially incomplete data? Our audit will either confirm everything's working great, or show you exactly what needs fixing. Either way, you'll have confidence in your data."**

#### "Can you guarantee results?"

**"We stand behind our work with a satisfaction guarantee. If you're not satisfied with our service, we'll work with you to make it right. The 'Automated Verification Loop' keeps iterating until your tracking meets our quality standards."**

#### "We need to check with our team"

**"That makes total sense. Who else would be involved in this decision? [Listen] Would it be helpful if I sent you some information to share with them? What questions do you think they'll have?"**

### Closing (5 minutes)

#### The Assumptive Close

**"Based on everything we've discussed, it sounds like the [service tier] is the right fit. The next step is getting you scheduled. We have availability this week or next - what works better for your timeline?"**

#### The Alternative Close

**"Would you prefer to start with the Forensic Diagnostic and get the audit first, or jump straight into having us fix everything with the Signal Restoration service?"**

#### The Urgency Close

**"I want to be transparent - we only take on a limited number of clients each month to ensure quality. This week I have [number] spots remaining. Would you like to secure one of those?"**

## Objection Handling Cheat Sheet

### Cold Email - LinkedIn Connection

```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s GA4 setup

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're the [Title] at [Company] - impressive growth you've been having!

Quick question: How confident are you in your GA4 signal integrity?

I ask because many businesses we work with in [industry] have significant tracking gaps they don't know about. Some are about to cut their Facebook ad budget because it "isn't working" - turns out the tracking is broken, not the ads.

If you're interested, I can run an audit on [website] and show you exactly what's working vs. what's broken. Takes 5 minutes to set up, 48 hours to complete.

Worth checking?

Best,
[Name]
P.S. Our Forensic Diagnostic starts at $1,450 - let me know if you'd like to learn more.

Subject: Re: [Company]'s GA4 setup

Hi [Name],

Did my last email get buried? I know the feeling.

Quick reminder: I offered to audit [Company]'s tracking setup. Based on your website, I suspect there might be some attribution issues (most businesses have them post-GA4 migration).

If you'd rather not know about potential tracking problems, totally understand.

But if you're curious what issues might be lurking, takes 30 seconds to request: [link]

Either way, hope [Company] keeps crushing it.

Yes or no: Are you 100% confident your tracking is perfect?

That's it.

## Advanced Sales Techniques

### The Diagnostic Sale

Position yourself as a doctor diagnosing a problem, not a vendor selling a service.

### The Consultative Approach

Ask more questions than you make statements. Let them sell themselves.

### The Educational Close

Teach them about tracking problems until they realize they need help.

### The Assumptive Partnership

Speak as if you're already working together: "When we restore this..." instead of "If you hire us..."

### The Risk Reversal

Remove all risk from their decision with guarantees and proof.
